This text file contains a high level modular description of my implementation an MPC used to drive 
the udacity simulator car around the test track succesfully with the requirements intact.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Model:

A motion model is a set of equations or constraints used to describe the movement of a moving object. 
In our case, to describe the movement of a car we make use of a simple kinematic model that ignores 
the forces involved.

The state of the car at any given moment in time is a 4 component vector: x position, y position, 
heading angle and velocity;
State: x (x pos), y (y pos), psi (heading angle), v (velocity)

while the actuators or the controls consist of steering input and the accelerator/deccelerator input.
Control inputs: ùõø (steering angle), a(+/- acceleration)

With time, there is a change in the state of the car because of the actuator inputs. The new state of 
the car is described as a function of its old state, the actuator input values, and the time elapsed 
between the two states using our motion model. 

In the implementation of this MPC, the below motion model was used:

Let's say, 
Old state -> x, y, psi, v
Actuator inputs -> ùõø, a

New state after time dt -> x_new, y_new, psi_new, v_new

x_new = x + v * cos(psi) * dt  
y_new = y + v * sin(psi) * dt
psi_new = psi - v * ùõø / Lf * dt 			(Note: The negative value of the second is 
							because of the sign convention of steering 
							values in the simulator.)
v_new = v + a * dt

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timestep Length and Elapsed Duration (N & dt) tuning and dealing with latency:

To control the car as desired, we need to compare the ideal path we want it to take with a predicted 
path given a series of inputs. The time T over which this predicted path is calculated using the 
motion model and the input values is called the prediction horizon. This prediction horizon is a 
product of two variables, N and dt. 

N is the number of timesteps in the horizon. dt is the time elapsed between actuations. The general 
guidelines to decide the value of these MPC hyperparameters are that T should be as large as possible, 
while dt should be as small as possible. These guidelines create tradeoff between computational time 
and the closeness to the ideal path acheived.

I started tuning N and dt by first setting the simulated latency between actuation commands and 
actuations to 0.

I set N to 10, dt to 1, the reference velocity to 50 and observed the performance.
The car moved very slowly and was going out of track at certain points and I figured that the 
actuations were too sparse, so I started decreasing dt until the car was able to move comfortably 
around the whole track at a dt value of 0.2!

Then I increased the reference velocity to 100 and checked the performance. The car still comfortable
completed the track but was now faster and reached a max speed of about 80 mph.

Now I introduced a 100ms latency to simulate the real world scenario. I added this to the model by 
adding a 100ms to the dt which was 0.2s. Thus the new dt became 0.12s with latency modeled into it. 

The test around the simulator track proved the working of this hyperparamter setting of N=10 and 
dt=1.2!
